# Discord client for Symbian^3 devices

Based on Qt 4.7.4 using QML widgets. Most of the code is in TypeScript, which then compiles to QML-compatible JavaScript.

The client requires a middleware/proxy server running somewhere, see [discord-symbian-server](https://github.com/ruslang02/discord-symbian-server).
